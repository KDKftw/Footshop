Footshop test
This test script was created as a task for my application to Footshop. Task was to test adding converse shoes to basket, starting at the main page.

I went through three pages total and I created file for each of them containing page objects (POM) that were found via Page Factory.
I used log4j for logging and JUnit as a testing framework.

The main file where tests are executed is ConverseTest. Files Converse and Test do not need to be present for the test to be executed but I let them be there to show the progress
of the code and how I approached it.
